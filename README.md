# What this is
This is a very simply weather app built with node.js, express.js, socket.io and mongoose (Mongodb)

## How to use
If you'd like to play around with this project, feel free to clone it!  Also, if you intend to use Vagrant, simply type vagrant up into your terminal and wait for the files to download.  Next, type vagrant ssh, cd /vagrant and finally npm start.  Mongodb will automatically start up for and you may then visit (http://localhost:5000) to play with the app!
